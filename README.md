# Challenge-Regression


## Description

This project was realised in the context of the Becode AI Bootcamp.
The goal was to code regressions from a real estate dataset in order to predict prices through a 
Machine Learning Model. 


- Feature Engineering.ipnyb is a Jupyter Notebook containing the preprocessing procedures such as data cleaning and 
*Features engineering* through *One-Hot Encoding*. 

- Regression.ipnyb is a Jupyter Notebook containing the plots and regression models


## Installation

The codes were written using a Jupyter Notebook and python 3.9.
The plots will require latest versions of Matplotlib, Seaborn and SKlearn. 
The obtained plots are saved in the **Plots** folder in the PNG format. 


## Usage 

To predict housing prices in Belgium. 
The code can't be used as is, it requires some more coding to take user's inputs and 
draw conclusions from them. 


## Timeline

This project was realised between 10.02.22 and 16.02.22.
